		<h1>Filipino Style Giniling (Afritada Style)</h1>
		<img src="../images/giniling.jpg" alt="Afritada Recipe" width="400"/>
		<p>This dish is one of my favorites to eat. It's a comfort food for me, and I love it. This is my own personal way of making this. <br />
		It's pretty easy to make and does not take long all. This dish is a Philippine dish, and it is usually eaten with white rice. Contrary to the picture, you will not add peas.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tablespoon oil, or as needed</li>
			<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
			<li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
			<li>1 cups water, or as needed</li>
			<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>⅓ cup and ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon soy sauce, divided</li>
			<li>2 medium red potatoes</li>
			<li>10 baby carrots, or more to taste, cubed</li>
			<li>½ cup raisins, or more to taste</li>
			<li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce with salt (such as Contadina®)</li>
			<li>½ orange bell pepper, diced</li>
			<li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Step 1</strong><br />
				<p>
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. 
Add beef and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper 
and add more water as needed; do not let beef dry out.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Step 2</strong><br />
				<p>
Add 3 tablespoons soy sauce, potatoes, and carrots to the saucepan with the beef. Add more water as needed to 
prevent drying out. Cook 4 minutes; add raisins. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more, adding water as
needed to make sure beef does not dry out.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Step 3</strong><br />
				<p>
Add 1 can of sauce to the saucepan with the beef mixture. Fill that can with water, stir to remove excess sauce, 
and pour water into saucepan. Add 1/2 of the remaining can of sauce to the saucepan; stir to combine. Add more
water as needed to create a sauce-like but not soupy consistency.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Step 4</strong><br />
				<p>
Add bell pepper, remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, and sugar. Cook until all vegetables are soft, about 3 to 5 
minutes more, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed to be sure the sauce does not dry out.
				</p>
			</li>
