		<h1>Filipino Style Giniling (Afritada Style)</h1>
		<img src="../images/giniling.jpg" alt="Afritada Recipe" width="400"/>
		<p>This dish is one of my favorites to eat. It's a comfort food for me, and I love it. This is my own personal way of making this. <br />
		It's pretty easy to make and does not take long all. This dish is a Philippine dish, and it is usually eaten with white rice. Contrary to the picture, you will not add peas.
